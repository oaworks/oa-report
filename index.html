<h2>Q&A</h2>

<h3>When will OAcheck be generally available?</h3>
<p>We don’t know. OAcheck is already powering work at the Gates Foundation, and we’re working to make it generally available. If you’d like to help accelerate that, get in touch.</p>

<h3>What will OACheck cost?</h3>
<p>We don’t have details yet. As with all OA.Works tools, we plan to provide a free tier that will enable anyone to advance open access. We’ll also provide a paid for tier with flexible pricing for institutions who want more than we can provide freely.</p>

<h3>What data does OACheck use?</h3>
<p>OACheck will use all the sources listed on our infrastructure page, manual extraction where required, and your internal sources (e.g finance systems, previously generated lists etc).</p>

<h3>We OACheck help even if we don’t have a policy, but still want to help our authors make their work open?</h3>
<p>We’re not sure, but we have plans for something that could. Get in touch.</p>

<h3>What type of policies will it cover?</h3>
<p>Funder, university, and government Open Access policies globally.</p>
