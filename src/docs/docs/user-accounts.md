When you sign up for OA.Report, we'll send you a “magic” login link that allows anyone who clicks it to access [private parts of ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]your report, including insights, in-depth analytics, and strategies.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Treat your login link like a password. Keep your login link safe, and only share it with people you trust. If your login link is no longer private, [get in touch](mailto:joe@oa.works), and we'll change it.
{% endhint %}

You can log in as many devices as you want with your login link. Multiple people can also use this link. They won’t need a username or password, and you won't need to authorize their accounts. This makes it easy to give access to your report at your institution securely. Users can log out at any point, and your access will expire after one year.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you can't find your link, search your inbox for "OA.Report login link"
{% endhint %}
