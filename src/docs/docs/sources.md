OA.reports builds on open data like OpenAlex, Crossref, and ShareYourPaper. In our premium plans, we can ingest the institution's internal data, and collect our own to help power more insights and strategies.

Thanks to all these services for sharing open data we can build off:

* [Crossref](https://crossref.org/)

* [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) (and [their sources](https://docs.openalex.org/additional-help/faq#where-does-your-data-come-from))
* [Shareyourpaper.org Permissions](https://shareyourpaper.org/permissions)
